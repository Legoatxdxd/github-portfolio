## 👋 About Me

I'm a young, motivated developer building real skills in software engineering and problem solving. My main focus is **C#**, and I enjoy tackling algorithmic challenges and learning new languages and tools. I’m currently expanding my toolset with **C++** and I have experience creating content and tools in **Roblox Studio**.

I’m hungry for experience — I’m looking for paid or volunteer projects where I can contribute, learn, and grow. I’m available for hire and open to contract or freelance work.
